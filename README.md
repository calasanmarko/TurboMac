# TurboMac
*Stops CPU throttling on Intel-based Macs*

# Summary
A malfunctioning or missing battery and an overzealous thermal controller can cause unnecessary throttling on many Macs, which can be quite hard to get rid of and bring them to a near-unusable state. By setting the appropriate values on the **IA32_HWP_REQUEST (0x774)** or **IA32_PERF_CTL (0x199)** MSR, TurboMac keeps your device on a high performance profile.

# Disclaimer
**NO WARRANTY! I AM NOT TO BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES.**

This product was designed around a personal need - getting rid of the unbearable CPU throttling after my girlfriend's laptop battery died. As such it has only been tested on one device - a Macbook Pro 2017 running Catalina. **It only works on Intel-based Macs.**

We are messing with CPU registers dealing with thermals, so appropriate care is recommended. Something going *seriously* wrong is pretty unlikely by itself, but in combination with other factors (did you mess with your fan settings? BD_PROCHOT?), and Macs' overall sensitivity you could, if very unlucky, end up causing permanent damage to your CPU.

# Installation
**DISCLAIMER: Disabling SIP brings your system to a more vulnerable state. It is recommended that after installation you re-enable SIP (without the kext restriction) by running `csrutil enable --without kext` from Recovery mode. Even after you've done this, as long as the kext signing restriction remains disabled you should take special care when installing kexts.**

1. *OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher:* Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) by running `csrutil disable` from the terminal in Recovery mode.
2. *OS X 11 (Big Sur) and higher:* Also disable Authenticated Root by running `csrutil authenticated-root disable` from Recovery mode.
3. Open the Build folder
4. Grant the installer appropriate for your OS version execution privileges using `chmod +x /path/to/installer` from the Terminal.
5. Open the appropriate installer and follow further instructions. Make sure you **don't reboot until the installer script is fully complete. MacOS will prompt you to restart too soon.**

You can verify that the extension has loaded correctly by seeing if it shows up when you type `kextstat | grep TurboMac` in the Terminal.

# Uninstallation
Follow the same steps as in the Installation section, except open the uninstallation script instead of the installation script. You can entirely re-enable SIP and Authenticated Root when done.
